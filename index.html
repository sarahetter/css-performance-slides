                        Won't talk about differences between browsers, just keep in mind that each one has their own implementation, and differ slightly

                            <p>Once the browser loads in your HTML & CSS, it begins building objects that represent your site.</p>
                            <p>First off - DOM (Document Object Model). This is a tree structure that, if you have done any JS programming, you are very familiar with. Each element in your HTML is a node, and nodes have children. The DOM should be identical between browsers, however if you have incorrectly nested HTML each browser has a slightly different way of parsing through & attempting to correct errors, so there may be slight differences.</p>

                            <p>Once done dom, it creates the CSS Object Model. This is a model that is much like the DOM, but for CSS. It is a tree structure. It contains objects like: StyleSheetList, CSSStyleSheet, CSSStyleRule.</p>

                        <p>After the browser has finished making the DOM and the CSSOM, it combines them both into another model called the Render Tree</p>

                        <p>The render tree is created by going through the DOM (things that actually exist on the website), and adding the CSS rules from the CSSOM to those DOM nodes.</p>

                        <p>Render tree doesn’t contain things that are hidden by CSS (display:none)</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Style Sharing</li>
                            <li>CSS Rule Hash Tables</li>

                        </ul>
                        <aside class="notes">
                            <p>How the render tree is created is fairly important.
                                The dom isn’t matched against every single CSS rule, because that would be insanely slow.
                                The browser uses different intermediate sorts / searches and data structures to make this matching faster.</p>
                            <p>A data structure is a way of organizing data. There are many different types of data structures, and they each have a different way of making the task of dealing with data more efficient.</p>
                            <p>Each browser uses any or all of these, and their exact implementation may be different. There may be some other efficiencies added!</p>

                            <p><strong>Style Sharing</strong> - simply means that a browser figures out which DOM elements share the exact same styles (for example, two li’s in the same list). This saves having to do the exact same work more than once.</p>

                            <p><strong>CSS Rule Hash tables</strong>. - A hash table (simply put) is an associative array. When creating a hash table, you feed the element you are adding into a hash function, which calculates an index to place that element at in the array. When matching elements from the DOM to this hashtable, you just do that backwards. SO find hash, and only look at elements in that spot in the array. Saves from looking at every other element in other indices.</p>
                            <p>Sometimes there are hash tables within hashtables</p>

                        <small>By David Eppstein - self-made, originally for a talk at WADS 2007, Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=2609777</small>
                        <aside class="notes">
                            <p><strong>Ancestor Filters</strong> - the browser checks to see if this is part of a set. It uses something called a Bloom Filter. A bloom filter uses a large array, and sets all elements in array to one bit - 0. Then, when running elements through the filter, it uses another type of hash function, which gets a number of indices. Then the original bits in the index at those indices are set to 1. So when checking against this filter, you can know for sure if your element matches - if all of it’s hash indexes are 1, then it may be in the set. If any of them are 0, then it is definitely not in the set. This narrows down how many selectors the browser has to compare against.</p>

                        <p><strong>Recursive process</strong> -
                        First finds width of parent, then loops down to the deepest node, and finds it’s size & positioning, then goes up through the tree.</p>
                        <p>This is why when you have a fixed height and width on a parent, if the contents are larger they overflow.</p>

                        <p>As far as your stylesheet structure, The Browser is doing most of the work for you.</p>
                        <p>Because of the work done & efficiencies added at the Render Tree creating stage, it is impossible to tell how each of your css rules will be parsed.</p>
                        <p>And as it turns out, the time it takes the browser to render different css selectors is negligible. (Ben Frain did a comparison in early 2014 with 20 diff selectors, and the biggest difference in time with a humonguous DOM (5000 nested elements) 14 ms. .</p>
                        <p>first selector - 50.4 ms. second - 50.2 ms, third - 64.6 ms</p>
                        <p>Difference is in Chrome. diff between first two is easily within margin of error of the calculation method used</p>
                        <p>Different browsers had different slowest selector</p>
                        <p>It isn’t your job to write the CSS structure for the browser. It’s the browser’s job to make it efficient. Each engine does things a bit differently, so trying to guess how it will split up your selectors is futile.</p>
                        <p>However, one is way more semantic and easier to write. Don't JUST write it because it's faster, write it because it makes sense.</p>

                        There are limited things you can do to help load behaviour, but the major thing to know about CSS performance
                        is that it's not just about loading quickly, it's about how your site actually feels while using it. When there
                        are 'hiccups' in rendering, this is called jank. For example: when images load slowly, and layout is triggered, it makes
                        your site feel clunky.

                            transform translate only triggers composite, so no layout or paint are needed.

Then show difference in scrolling, how reddit flashes and cnn doesn’t. CNN scroll is a much better, less janky experience, even though reddit doesn’t have a lot to it - just text, small thumbnails.</p>

                            <p>Show FPS meter - looking for 60 FPS</p>

                            <p>Show scrolling perf issues - http://www.nytimes.com/ (shows mousewheel event listener) in top corner</p>

                            <p>Show layer borders - show in own presentation. Want to make layers small. Also notice that paint doesn't occur on animation, but on end of state when another class is added.</p>
